- Use Kotlin and jetpack compose

- Write idiomatic code, use the standard library where possible
- Use immutable data structures where possible
- if a task is not straightforward to implement: instead of implementing the task, refactor the code, so the task becomes straightforward to implement.
- suggest minimal changes
- organize as much code as possible in pure functions keep a minimal amount of impure functions which call the pure functions
- every pure function should live in its own file
- only add external dependencies if absolutely necessary
- if multiple independent changes need to be done, only do one change at a time and list which changes are left to be done.
- add and maintain tests for pure functions
- verbalize what exactly you intend to change BEFORE changing files, not after.
